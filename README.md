# Objectives 
Nowadays people stopped asking for simple resumes so it's necessary to make a portfolio also it helps you to stand out from other candidates. 
especially when your portfolio is a good look at UI and has outstanding animations.
also, it's a simple way to show them how much you know about what you are learning. 
I choose flutter for this because it's easy to build and it support great animations
